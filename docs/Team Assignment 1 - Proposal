Political Poll (Versus)
    Political Poll(Versus) is a quiz that gives advice on political stances. In 
    this quiz, you are continuously asked to make either-or choices between two 
    politicians who have the opposing political stances due to some specific 
    scenarios. This application will allow users to find out which candidates 
    have the same views as them. The GovTrack.us API will allow us to extract 
    politicians’ political history and their stances. Along with a text 
    interpreter API such as TextRazor API we can compare the govtrack data we
    gather and try to match a user’s answers to a politician. We would require a
    Facebook OAuth to start the quiz, and use a database to maintain a user’s 
    answers to questions. 


Face Hero
    Face Hero is a game where emojis fall from the top of the screen to the beat
    of a song, and you’d match the emotions with your webcam/face to score 
    points. Microsoft’s Azure Face API would allow us to extract emotion from a 
    visual feed, to check whether the player’s facial expression matches the 
    emojis’, and Spotify’s Music Analysis API identifies the location of beats 
    and bars for us to place targets/emojis. We would require a Facebook OAuth 
    to start playing, and use a database to maintain a score leaderboard for any 
    given song.
