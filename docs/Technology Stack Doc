Initially, we were considering between 
	- Vanilla HTML/CSS, Angular, and React for the frontend
	- Flask, Ruby on Rails, and Node for the backend framework
	- Mongo and SQLite for the database

We ultimately decided to go with vanilla HTML/CSS/JS for the front end (with Python's Jinja2 for templating), Flask for the web framework, and SQLite for the database

We chose SQLite because we don't need the performance boost of a NoSQL database, and are more familiar with SQL.
We went with Flask for the backend framework since our team is mostly familiar with Python
We decided on vanilla HTML/CSS/JS for the front end since, again, it's what our team is mostly familar with
