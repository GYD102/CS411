Initially, we were considering between 
	- Vanilla HTML/CSS, Angular, and React for the frontend
	- Flask, Ruby on Rails, and Node for the backend framework
	- Mongo and MySQL for the database

After frameworks we're familiar with and what we'd like to learn/work with over the course of the semester, we ultimately decided on using MERN -- MySQL, Express, React, and Node. 

We chose MySQL because we don't need the performance boost of a NoSQL database and are more familiar with SQL.
We went with Express and Node for the backend frameworks so that we could get more experience with JavaScript, and also since these frameworks are trending in the industry.
We decided on React for the front end (this is not used in our prototype, but is used in our main project (contained in the /versus directory on GitHub) for simplicty reasons) for similar reasons: to learn something new that is also trending.
